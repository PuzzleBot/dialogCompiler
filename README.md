# dialogCompiler
This is the result of a four-part project created for CIS 2750 (Winter 2015) at the University of Guelph.

To install, simply run the Bash script on the command line using the command:
 bash install_dialogc.sh
 
The script can be run with no flags, or one of the following at a time:
  --build : Only perform the actions which create the build directory ready to be installed, then stop
  --install : Perform only the installation actions assuming the build directory has been created
  
This application has been built specifically for Linux (as specified by the
instructor of the course at the time). Running this on Mac or Windows
may fail, since certain C header files are in different locations.

A second README should appear to provide further details after installation.
